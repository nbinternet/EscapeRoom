        Can you calculate how many hours it would take to crack the strong password <strong>Cloud123@#456aAfe</strong> (rounded up to the nearest hour)?
        <br>
        <div class="form-group mb-3">
            <label for password class="form-label">Input hours here:</label>
            <input class="bg-dark border-light form-control"

                That's correct!
                <div class="m-1 fw-lighter">
                    That's the correct number of hours for the password. That's a long time!

            That's not quite right...

                That's not quite right, double check your calculations. Remember it runs at 10,000 tries per second.
